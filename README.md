# HC-DBSCAN
This notebook explores clustering using synthetic datasets. It covers data generation (blobs, moons, circles), preprocessing with StandardScaler, Hierarchical Clustering on make_blobs with dendrogram visualization, and DBSCAN on make_moons and make_circles. Each clustering result is visualized, demonstrating algorithm performance on diverse data
